## Troubleshooting ⚠️ 
### Port Issues on macOS
If you encounter a "Port 5000 in use" error:
1. The game now uses port 8080 by default
2. If needed, you can modify the port in `main.py`
3. On macOS, port 5000 is often used by AirPlay Receiver
### Common Issues
1. Missing Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Game Not Loading
* Clear browser cache
* Verify Python version (3.11+)
* Check console for error messages
